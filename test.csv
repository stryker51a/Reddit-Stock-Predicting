h5393sy,Big bear case right here hear me out.   We saw in the 08 crash that QE is what really helped bring us back. In the covid crash we proved that theory but its obvious that we not actually us moreso rich people who sit on fat stacks of cash like fuckin smaug might start to be seeing the consequences of that... So how do we deal with a panic flash crash that is caused by the cure to the last crashes? If people see the feds balance sheet and see they used a lot more QE to cure any panic selling it may only induce more.  This time its not the Lehman brothers.. its the fed,8
h5398q5,Gold bugs mad AF that they finally get some inflation and their favorite shiny metal is still flat lmao.,8
h539h29,Fidelity downgraded me from level 2 options which ive had since 2018 to level 1 because I got drunk and messed around with a few of the retirement calculators/financial profile bullshit they put near the portfolios. I put in a way lower income than I have to see how it changed things so now despite me having 50k in my account they think im poor and not worthy of buying puts or calls. Cant re apply for a month or appeal the decision.   So I might just fuck around and build a well diversified portfolio of high quality companies that I feel are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value ... or just transfer my cash to TD Ameritrade which has had me approved for l2 options in my account with 0 in it for like a year and send it on some weeklies.,8

h52u7vt,This day traded almost exactly like the May CPI day. I remember buying calls and feeling so good about it until I realized Id really gotten caught in a true bull trap  no daytrades left. Ill bet it goes the same way as last time red as devil dick the next day.  Dont mistake the real drop for the bear traps at the top. Lower highs and lower lows in a stretch longer than like 5 minutes wasnt something we saw last week. This is us rounding the curve. Patience bulls. Your calls will be fine if theyve got till the end of next week.,7

h536q2q,You toss and turn as Elon gently rubs your shoulders. You seem a little tense says Elon as you look at your bank account. Your phone shows 107 left to your name.   You think to yourself while Elon rubs you down you pull open Robin Hood type in TSLA. Leaps 900 JAN 2023 are only 1 you can afford 1 leap. This is finally your chance to get rich youll be able to actually buy a Tesla. You ask Elon what the next Tesla will be.   He says U for you as he smiles sweetly. You picture him dancing on stage explaining U S3XY to everyone multiple times as you smile back at him.  All of a sudden Elon flips on the TV to CNBC to catch the tail end of Jim Cramer you see a new law has been passed we believe options have inflated the markets into a bubble we will be imposing a new rule next week only allowing accounts that qualify for day trades to also purchase options with a 25000 barrier to entry.  You start weeping aloud you feel a caring hand wipe your tear away its Elon again whats wrong my little X3?  Suddenly you wake youre in a pool of sweat at first you panic about the new options policy then youre filled with relief realizing that options arent restricted it was all a dream.  You realize this was actually a vision to earn 200000 gains to buy a TSLA leap. You log into RH it welcomes you with your 107 balance you plug in TSLA yolo 2023  900 and realize the options are actually 20 each. The best you can do is 900 TSLA weekly expiring around Christmas.  In a slight fit of despair you try to remember the feeling of Elon rubbing your cheek and rub one out onto your stomach then roll over back to sleep. A single tear rolls from your eye into your waifu pillow.  YOLO you whisper.,30

h52qfmn,Remember kids dont over leverage yourselves.   Investing 120 in SPY/VTI/VT/...  no matter what happens youre probably going to beat the general indexes without worrying about margin calls.   Being 400 in a meme stock without revenue  dont forget to charge your phone because the call is coming.,8
h52r9yv,I think I went a little too hard on spy calls eod. Its only down less than 0.4. Im still learning. Wont make that mistake again,7
h52vkkw,If youre wondering why rising bond yields caused the dip today this is an ELI5  Inflation means future payments from bonds wont buy as much  because the price of a banana or a bouquet of flowers will be higher than it is today. So when inflation expectations rise bonds are less desirable and their prices fall. That pushes up their yield.  In other words inflation is much higher than the feds are willing to say.,9

h533pnh,PCG Closed below 10 today  happened only one other time this year and it bounced off that quickly though it didnt bounce far.   Fundamentally PGE is a hated company but the key is  its not hated as much as it was 2 years ago and the stock doesnt reflect that yet.   1. Californians now understand wildfire season to be the new normal not some crazy thing PGE caused.   2. PGE got much better at managing PSPS events last year  they will get better again.  And Californians are more used to it now too.   3. The fact that the fire victims were given PGE stock means that even if PGE messed up again badly they probably wont get disassembled by the CPUC.   4. Theyve spent a ton of their cash getting the power lines in better shape  they may still have a bad wildfire season but the chances are lower.   If PGE has another summer like last year  bad but not awful I think we will see a substantial rebound in the stock price.   Q2 earnings July 29 and Investor Day in August could both be catalysts.   Positions   1000 shares 9.99   Sept 17 10 calls  .68,2

h5393xb,You have to realize that grocery stores tends to hardly break even on their fresh produce section.  The dollars of profit per square foot for the fresh produce are the worst in the store by far.  The dollar stores are so good damn profitable because they sell the nonperishable junk food shit without the overhead of offering decent food.  This is one of those scenarios where profit causes a god damn public health crisis because its hard for grocery stores to exist especially in urban environments with sky high real estate costs.,1

h52vpvi,RRP is rising like crazy but people downplayed it all year. Look at it almost 800 billion today...its absolutely nuts. At least in their recent report they somehow acknowledged it,2
h52xc08,and higher borrowing rates and weak dollar mean companies with low cash flow and high debt Most companies increased debt to survive the pandemic will take longer to pay off that debt so you see investors running from everything into FAANG for last couple months. SPY is going up because overall inflows are still steady from 401ks and money hasnt left for other investments however if inflation starts to be a worry the 401k inflows will be left by their own in the main market as the smart money shifts to inflation protected assets like TIPS and Gold and all that which is when the Indices will see another correction  COVID variants/outlasting vaccine protection will really be bad as it shoves the transitory inflation down the economys throat as it would mean continuing QE as the recovery chokes     OP is correct and Id blame the Delta variant for most of the inflation overshooting MoM expectations,2

Edit in my opinion the housing market is currently being carried by the weight of its own bullshit. There are some people left buying at this prices but far more people who just feel shit out of luck that they cant afford a home. It wont last.

h52xuaf,whats an example of your position and return on those?,1
h52ruyd,How are your calls doing Im diving in deep af tmrw,2
h536x7p,I would say 3 months bare minimum. If you wanna go with shorterterm debit and credit spreads are your jam.  Personal experience of course.  That ITM delta is gonna help you a lot more than you think.,2
h538jr4,You win some. You lose some.  The trick is to exit the position before the contract price goes below the price you paid for it.  And watch out for delta theta and Vega. They may wanna fight you.,2

h52y0bm,I started in February I have 3100 in mine had 1600 in April but its mostly still all my money and Im still down 1k from options I made 1k and would be up to 5k right now but Im retarded and so is this market. So Im now down the 1k I made plus my initial 9001k and been trying to break even since March. Mommy portfolio is like 37 dkng because I have 23 shares and I know youre suppose to diversify but Idgaf I like dkng and Im tired of seeing it being flat and beat up.,2

h536vwp,Fair point.  30?  As my mother told me on my 30th birthday Youre now closer to 40 than you are to 20.,3
h53bwk8,ok historical impact aside there was an inflation report out today that people have been waiting to see. the idea that its being used selectively today is wrong. not saying we dont rally but its not just like any other fearmongering headline,1
h533bxp,Do you have an metrics on that stock? Is it a good play in the long or mid range? I have some money in BOFA,1
h533d6k,Yeah??? Lol,1
h52x87g,You could be right but its hard to imagine a house getting cheaper with so much money in the system. The demand will level out at some point but inflation hit housing hard and fast. I have no doubt you will not find a 1500sf house in San Diego for less than 550k after things settle. These house are going for 700k now.,1
h539cbr,I have FDs expiring Friday.,1
h539ien,900  16.65 I like the stock. I can hold it aint going tits up. I thought 16.50ish would be the bottomish. I hope the guy who said 14 by end of week has a heart attack. Like not die but close.,2
h52twav,Survivor bias. You need to read up on this,2
h52rfn6,Eek well good luck to you man. Ive been in dark places with gambling problems before myself. Sometimes it takes a cold look at the mirror and to see the reality of whatever decisions you make going 13 years into the future to make you start making more helpful choices now. Switched to more primarily stock investing and got to a 20k portfolio after losing 15k in options gambling a couple years ago. Recently tried options again lost 15002000 but it was profit from loading up with 1k on the options account which I pulled out earlier.,3
h52tc13,Right. So you never actually invested you gambled. That is fine. It happens. Important thing is to stop that. There is no getting your money back as long as you think like that you are still gambling.  Start from scratch invest in shares. Then have a side account where you gamble but never mix those two. Strict rules.,1

h52yhkx,Trash things coming up. I typed jpow speech big calendar shows up,1
h532wa5,Dont worry none of your oil stocks are abusing special purpose entities or using future cost and oil price assumptions that are just aggressive enough to make them look more attractive than they really are but not so aggressive as to remove their ability to argue that the forecasts were potentially reasonable assumptions.,1

h53bej2,Should i wear pajamas too?,1
h531q92,Well shit see you on the other side,3
h52rgi8,Shit busted dammm,2
h5333bw,Implied Voltron.  Sometimes options get randomly crushed in value without a major price change in a stock.  Thats because the Greeks that measure options formed together into a Voltron and crushed it.,2
h52ypnt,This trash jpow speaking and i fomoed at 4.98 ,2
h533ilb,Optception!!,3
h537ezr,Pretty much though I dont have enough international figures to know how we compare to our contemporaries. If inflation is rising globally for developed nations investments here could still be the best option. In my opinion that would maintain growth longer.,1
h52vapw,Bought some at open and sold them about 20mins later,2
h52thfl,Bc those are solid companies lol BA literally has been bad news after bad news.,0
h532633,No. It triggers my PTSD...I had WKHS calls a few weeks ago. It still hurts.,1

h537no9,Love the entrepreneurial spirit,2
h52wfdg,How do I get into these growth and mid caps... asking for a friend who is pretty overleveraged to the tits in SPY,1
h52s5yi,FD or ban,1
h52wc16,Thx forgot to delete that,1
h532vnb,Shit good point,2
h52wyyy,And so do I. But look it up. Pretty interesting pivot,1
h533jrj,I hope so. Everyone is happier when spy isnt taking it in the shorts. Except for bears. But they dont count anyway.,1
h52yqsf,People are buying stuff early to get in on low rates to hedge against inflation. Its not gonna stop but Wells Fargo has been cutting lines of credit all over.,1
h52x5fi,Thanks Kamala,2
h52xg0l,Wait are you trying to say fox news is accurate or that your a dog trained to bark fox news when someone posts some truth.,1
h53adsu,how much is ur portfolio worth? i am down 4.5 today and decided to just put all my 50k in DIDI at 12.28. valuations seem attractive and the ccp thing seems a bit overblown,2
h532baz,Sure Wish I had a Faster Truck.,1
h533a9t,Prime was sued for fucking over its employees I mean contractors.  Time for a new career in finance.,1
h52qxo0,Troll me all you want but fuck you for making fun of people getting cancer.,1
h52r8xv,I know you wish something was coming but its not. They filed a lawsuit for discrimination because they were salty that they didnt get the EV mail truck fleet contract. You got a spike today due to the lawsuit. They wont win. Nothing is coming. Best of luck to you,0
h52tnrk,I guess the issue was loading up on random calls/puts. The SPY puts barely printed while all calls got hammered. And these are all weeklies too. Try again next week when things settle. Also got greedy and loaded on stupid meme calls. Bad idea,2
h534i1o,Time marches on,1
h52zdwn,Kisses VM. I love you so,2
h53552x,i have. key word doesnt. lol,1
h53569l,,2

h53bvrs,yeah let me know when its passed. i love weed but grandpa doesnt.,1

h52ular,Calm down schizoid.,2
h52taz8,So value stock are safe right?,1
h52tozg,Lol jesus. Jumping like 9 conclusions here.   You seem like the crazy crackhead yelling on the corner about some bs that peripherally makes sense but your cracked so no one engages,1

h532jyi,AMD ,5
h5345i2,Yup shares are probably the way.  I bought a couple options today  probably a bad idea considering the decay buy Ill unload them soon.,2
h536esd,if you cash out quickly theres prolly gonna be some dip at some point this month. wonder if i should hedge with a qqq put....,2
h5346dl,I will fite you,2
h533tdn,Me too,2
h533aa6,Third and final question. Are you buying news or the rumor?,1
h534770,Zoom out and maybe look at nonmeme stocks like CRLBF.  Note how CRLBF is down from the peak but back in 2020 it was all the way down to 2.  Theres room to run in either direction so Im going to hold until the bill is about to pass and then Im getting the fuck out before it passes.,1
h5325oa,Hey. Arent you the guy who accused me of skipping  day??,2
h533pik,You turned a straight girl gay  well done!,4

h52y0hl,Lmao I can assure you I am not trading AMC at all,0
h5304q7,No I read about it last week,1
h530igi,https//www.greenmarketreport.com/tilrayasksshareholderstoapprovedilution/  From june 29th,1
h531tmj,Could be the play. Im hoping for another big run up before then after the legalization plan is announced tomorrow.,1
h53341p,Yeah I didnt downvote gave you upvotes just now to balance it out for you brother ,2
h52rw6w,Spy vs. Spy. Love to see it.  I wish you the best on the battlefield sir,2
h5305ol,Im rooting for it but not holding my breath.,1
h537b29,It was some BS FUD article anyway but theyre referring to concentrates that can actually be that high.,2
h535ns5,In his defense that article reads like it was written by a toddler with autocorrect cranked up to 11.,1
h533ryg,Nah its not loading for me. I just read the headline lol my bad,1
h534sh5,HAHAHAH this is what happens when you dont get out much and read too much of the news.,1
h53448x,I didnt research like a 12 year old by googling a made up word. Here is the actual research paper which shows correlation to people with vomiting problems already https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3576702/,0
h534pk0,Which will probably also get fucked from vol crush.,1
h52x5gm,Im glad they updated your flair you dont even recognize witty banter,3

h52zm4r,Hope youre sells CCs on those bags you got there,1
h52v3kx,Tell him Happy Bday for me. Good dads seem rare nowadays,2
h52tmk1,Might see it tomorrow. I bought this dip hard. Prob too hard. Will average down if needed,2
h52zvzb,Yep. About 1015 mins after.,1
h52w5bf,Eat a big meal with it  when i took it without food it literally made holes in my stomach lining not a great time,1
h52w7mu,Nah u gud,1
h52wbew,It makes me irrationally pissed off at everything.,1
h52wunv,Its possible but you also may be pleasant as Tom Hanks and eat through everything in your fridge. Its a toss up,1
h52x5un,My biggest side effect was waking up in the refrigerator at 3am   I gain 1015 lbs everytime I take prednisone in a week,1
h52yij0,LIke some of our apes mentioned short term you can expect difficulty sleeping and stomach irritation. Thats why taking it with food in the morning is important. Some find that although they are more energetic they are also more irritable as well.  If youre on it for long term then well be monitoring any preexisting conditions that it can worsen such as high blood pressure diabetes and osteoporosis.,1

h52x9ci,Do I look like I can give legal advice??,1
h530sba,I said I think. I had to vacate a property once and didnt have to pay and my insurance paid for temp housing  Quick Google search  Some jurisdictions require you to pay withheld rent to the clerk of courts some allow tenants to simply not pay and others have no provision for withholding rent at all. Only by checking with an attorney or thoroughly researching your jurisdictions legal requirements can you know for sure and potentially avoid eviction.  ,1
h5343id,Interesting. Maybe only my industry is hesitant to give equity. But Im a registered broker so I guess that makes sense. Only managers get equity usually in my industry,1
h52so8l,I had a friend who is dumb and poor who paid 800 for a juicer. That phase lasted a few months. Shes still dumb and poor though.,1
h52w5c7,Haha wow thats a lot of salt. The bags must be heavy.   Yeah no shit it jumped in one day. But only after consolidating at 130 for months. And before 130 it was consolidating between 90100 for years. Im a long term holder of this stock and it only got to this level by demonstrating incredible growth,1
h533y7r,Thats assuming the market reacts rationally or that the planned increase eclipses the drawdown in the next EIA report,1
h537xca,I mean ive been wrong on tesla Never shorted tho just was bearish so who knows maybe the full self thats been a year away for 5 years will finally hit,2

h5365mg,I surely am not holding anymore.,1
h534j1q,Not Me lol. Im an OG actually,1
h52ubgh,I did get a perfect 420 on my THC exam though. Check mate.,2
h52z8fb,I was dumb and sold them before holding for a year so still have to pay a boatload of taxes. But I started buying leaps around when spy was at 230 or so SPY 400 calls for Jan 2022. Sold in the money.  Made about 140k profit and there were probably significant losses to IV dropping over time since I bought basically at the IV peak of the pandemic crash.,1
h52sicq,Im still up 17k overall on them but Im all out of cash to buy more ,1
h5371ny,Ok thx!,1
h53agx4,Thx!,1
h52z4p3,DKNG is a long play. Sub 50 I just keep adding to my position.,1
h537x1o,Haha thats hilarious  and scary. Its weird to say 30s. I dont feel different at all though. Just getting hotter .. cause FL lol,2
h52xi6h,Dude a 700k house going for 550k is exactly the type of correction Im talking about. Im not saying theres a 2008 esque housing crash coming but covid made house prices shoot the fuck up and thats just not sustainable.,1
h539irt,Lolz I sold a put when SOFI was at 19 now its deep ITM expiring next Friday. Good thing I didnt go full retard.,1
h539q4k,Haha  I hear you my friend! I am in it for the long haul once it recovers I will sell covered deep OTM LEAP to exit graciously.,2

h533qmz,So what youre saying is when you see me on the real forming like Voltronhttps//youtu.be/2kkJDHRYxWM I get deep like a Navy SEAL?,1
h52yyv2,I went in at 4.38. I feel your pain. I think were still good though.,1
h52xa2q,Oh gotcha.,1
h52tl00,And it still went up next 2 days by 10.,1
h53bcge,Was 35 now about 25k. The calls I got were EDU 7.5 calls expiring Friday. Might want to take a look. They are pretty cheap right now but who knows,1
h536yqg,Yup,1
h52rh1v,I dont even care about the contract they have so many orders already and they continue to recieve patents for new products this company is going to be a beast in a couple years its coming whether its in a week or 2 years,0
h52tsjm,Stick to spy. Ive made tens of thousands on them the last month,1
h534voq,If you dont know its too late.,1
h52yysy,My guess is after November 2022  Nothing stops them from talking about it though,1
h538ofc,I agree. But it would be like someone ringing a fire alarm in a wuhan market.,1
h5383qw,What about those of us who made new accounts but have been here for years?,1
h537ug7,To be fair. I read past post.  This has been a retard sub for a long time.   It didnt just start.,-1
h535dsp,Thanks for asking the question though. I forgot about the options on these. If I had a superstrong feeling one way or the other for the medium term Id probably buy ITM calls on TQQQ or SQQQ depending on which way I felt the market going.,2
h533jzm,The rumor as always. Thats where the big gains are my friend.,0
h532j0n,Probably.  And just for the record I hit legs yesterday.  Today is arms/shoulders tomorrow SPY crashes.,1
h533kmd,You too broski! Have a good one!,1
h52q7xh,No lol. Look up covered calls and cash secured puts.,1
h52se92,No that creates a spread which can be a theta play. He probably sells cash secured puts and covered calls.,1
h530d1a,I dont believe you.  Go Ducks.,0

h53133k,I hear ya.  Just staying typically just not paying rent ends badly.  they send you to collections then you have to go to court.  Nightmare scenario that you want to avoid if you can.,1

h53678e,Why not?,0
h534n6q,You paperhanded. Sorry youre gonna miss the train.,0
h5334xo,so if you hold options for over a year you dont have to pay taxes on that gain??   i always get nervous holding leaps due to IV crush,1
h52y85c,Oh well if thats the case you can def get em cheaper but the 400k pre covid prices are gone for good unless we all lose our jobs. My condo is worth 50k more then I paid. My rent will be forever cheap.,1
h530g07,If you blow Ill make the rest happen,2
h533l98,What oil stocks u got? Im overweight energy as well rn.,1
h52rny7,Im just letting you know where that spike came from. It immediately dropped back off. Not a sign of anything to coming in the next week or 2. Decent company yes. Just clarifying it will take some time for this to go back up,0
h52tz3n,Perhaps I should,2
h537zba,Very true. I used to be able to actually get feedback when I asked for input tho. Now its just spamming tickers.,2
h535jsq,I cant imagine the Nasdaq keeps this up for weeks...but we really never know. maybe Ill do some QQQ puts to play it safer.,2
h533xor,stay swole friend. were going to need our strength and endurance once the crash crashes. just a little /s,2
h52r3za,I understand covered calls not the latter. Thanks mane,2

h5367gq,says the guy that has missed three trains already...,1
h534rte,Well my average was 59.27 with 250 shares,0
h533h9o,You pay less  half the federal taxes.  Think its the same either way for state. So you end up with something like 10 less overall.,2
h533rbo,OIH good sir. Playing the divergence in stock price and WTI price,2
h52sbge,It didnt come from that it was stock price manipulation from HFs had nothing to do with that,0
h538ayw, That pet is annoyiny,1
h535zn0,Yeah what I meant by weeks was that we wouldnt breach that ATH for at least a few weeks. I see either some sideways movement where Ill sell a little and buy a little SQQQ or a nice quick day or two drop where Ill sell what I have for a nice return.,2
h534q5a,Gotta hold these buckets of bull tears that are filling up fast.,2
h52w9yo,well hes calling it fake news so maybe we got a bit more to go.  im sure well correct eventually or have a real red day tho.  its kinda hilarious he kept on going on about 20 days moving avg tho,1
h53220u,you put the hammer on the nail,0
h536bcg,Actually I bought in at 48 and 53 on the way up,0
h534wjp,Nice nice. I dont have any oil services myself. Def upside if we see capex pick up more with prices at these levels. Im sure once the hedges from this year roll off and frackers can realize higher prices they will be able to self fund pretty solid capex. Not sure how I feel about oil services longer term though. I just been playing oil with mostly COP since I like them longer term. They will do pretty well in a situation where frackers come back in with increased capex and push prices down a bit since COP has a hella low break even and in a situation where prices keep rising they are unhedged and have a decent amount of short cycle projects they could ramp up if they make sense.,1
h52smpt,Obviously youre in full retard mode. Im happy to sell you a few short ladders so you can have your war.,0
h536oea,yeah three trains missed to make crazy money already. Hold a bit longer and you may miss the train to make money at all on the trade.,1
h52sx8f,Been watching this stock for 5 years that had nothing to do with the usps contract,0
h52t5c0,Holy shit just had a look at your comment history!!!You do nothing but spam the shit outta this ticker. Puts on your mental health my man. I hope you seek therapy so you can see clearly. Again best of luck to you,0
